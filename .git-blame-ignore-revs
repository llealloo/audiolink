# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# After running the above, commits listed in this file will be
# ignored by git blame. The blame will be shifted to the person
# who edited the line(s) before the ignored commit.
#
# To disable this ignorance for a command, run as follows
# git blame --ignore-revs-file="" <other options>
#
# Note:
# - The comment above the SHA should be the first line of the commit.
# - It is fine to pack together similar commits if they have the same explanatory comment.
# - Use only 40 character git SHAs; not smaller ones, not prefixed with rB.
