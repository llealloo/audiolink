# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - September 18th, 2022
### New features
- Added Global Strings - text which can be read from AudioLink compatible shaders. Use this to retrieve the name of the local player and master in a shader, or to feed custom string data through. Info on usage is in Documentation. See `AudioLinkGetGlobalStringChar(uint stringIndex, uint charIndex)` in AudioLink.cginc for details.

## 0.2.8 - May 14th, 2022
### New features
- AudioLink theme colors are now configurable via the AudioLink controller with a slick color-picker GUI. (Thanks, DomNomNom)
- Added the ability to get the time since Unix epoch in days, and milliseconds since 12:00 AM UTC. Additionally, a helper function, `AudioLinkGetTimeOfDay()` has been added, which lets you easily get the current hours, minutes and seconds of the time of day in UTC.
- An editor scripting define, `AUDIOLINK`, which will be automatically added when AudioLink is included. (Thanks, Float3)
- AudioLink can now compile without VRCSDK and UDON, for use outside of VRChat. This kind of usecase is still experimental at best, though. (Thanks, Float3 and yewnyx)
- Added a few new helper methods to sample various notes of the DFT. (Thanks, Float3)
### Changes
- AudioLink theme colors have been cleaned up, including a new demo in the example scene, and the ability to change the colors in realtime in the editor. (Thanks, DomNomNom)
- Changed a few default settings on the AudioLink controller to be more responsive. (Thanks, DomNomNom)
- Changed folder structure to put less clutter into user projects.
### Bugfixes
- Fix vertical UV flip of the AudioLink texture on Quest. (Thanks, Shadowriver)
- Fix error when using "Link all sound reactive objects to this AudioLink" button. (Thanks, Nestorboy)
- Add a header guard to `AudioLink.cginc` to prevent duplicate includes. (Thanks, PiMaker)
- Fix various warnings in shader code. (Thanks, Float3)
- Fix NaN-propagation issue in the included video player. (Thanks, Texelsaur)
- Add a player validity check to the included video player. (Thanks, Texelsaur)
- Use `Networking.LocalPlayer.isInstanceOwner` instead of `Networking.IsInstanceOwner`, which is broken. (Thanks, techanon)
- The logos on the AudioLink controller were using point filtering, which was changed to bilinear. (Thanks, DomNomNom)

## 0.2.7 - December 1st, 2021
### New features
- Make AudioLink framerate-invariant, instead of assuming a specific framerate. Features that rely on timing have been updated to reflect this change.
- Add helper functions `AudioLinkGetChronoTime`, `AudioLinkGetChronoTimeNormalized`, `AudioLinkGetChronoTimeInterval` to more easily sample chronotensity values. `AudioLinkGetChronoTime(index, band)` functions as a more-or-less drop-in replacement for `_Time.y`.
- Move `ALPASS_CCCOLORS` section from `(24,22)` to `(25,22)` to avoid confusion. Code that uses the define should continue to work fine.
### Bugfixes
- Fix a nasty bug where mirrors would sometimes causing AudioLink to stop functioning when observed from specific angles.
- Fix erroneous timing code for filtered VU and ColorChord.
- Fix some issues in the documentation.
- Version number was wrong last release. It is fixed now.

## 0.2.6 - August 10th, 2021
### New features (big thanks to @cnlohr and @pema99)
- Chronotensity feature provides timing information to shaders which changes in reaction to audio
- ColorChord index colors, a new way to get audio reactive colors from ColorChord
- Globally configurable theme colors
- Filtered VU, smoothly filtered versions of VU data
- Amplify nodes and example shaders for above features
- Added `AudioLinkGetAmplitudeAtFrequency` and `AudioLinkGetAmplitudeAtNote` functions for easily sampling specific parts of the audio spectrum corresponding to certain frequencies or semitones
### Changes
- UnU sliders (thanks Texelsaur)
- Various improvements to included video player, now with a resync button (thanks again, Texelsaur)
- Recursive / nesting support for AudioReactiveSurfaceArray prefab
### Bugfixes
- Fixed certain parts of filtered 4band data always being zero (thanks DomNomNom)

## 0.2.5 - June 7th, 2021
